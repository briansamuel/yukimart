// Run with: php artisan tinker < test_track_inventory_removal.php

echo "=== Track Inventory Removal Test ===\n\n";

echo "1. Testing Product Model (should not reference track_inventory):\n";
echo "// Create a product\n";
echo "\$product = Product::factory()->make();\n";
echo "// Check if track_inventory is in casts (should be false)\n";
echo "array_key_exists('track_inventory', \$product->getCasts()); // Should return false\n";

echo "\n2. Testing Product Methods (should work without track_inventory):\n";
echo "// Test canOrder method\n";
echo "\$product->canOrder(5); // Should check available quantity only\n";

echo "// Test needsReordering method\n";
echo "\$product->needsReordering(); // Should compare stock vs reorder point\n";

echo "\n3. Testing ProductService (should not filter by track_inventory):\n";
echo "\$productService = app(App\\Services\\ProductService::class);\n";
echo "\$lowStock = \$productService->getLowStockProducts();\n";
echo "// Should return all products with low stock, not just those with track_inventory=true\n";

echo "\n4. Testing ProductFactory (should not include track_inventory fields):\n";
echo "\$product = Product::factory()->make();\n";
echo "// Check if track_inventory fields are missing\n";
echo "isset(\$product->track_inventory); // Should be false\n";
echo "isset(\$product->allow_backorder); // Should be false\n";
echo "isset(\$product->low_stock_alert); // Should be false\n";

echo "\n5. Testing Inventory Factory (should have quantity = 0 by default):\n";
echo "\$inventory = Inventory::factory()->make();\n";
echo "echo \$inventory->quantity; // Should be 0\n";

echo "\n6. Testing InventoryTransaction Factory:\n";
echo "\$transaction = InventoryTransaction::factory()->purchase()->make();\n";
echo "echo \$transaction->transaction_type; // Should be 'purchase'\n";
echo "echo \$transaction->quantity_change; // Should be positive\n";

echo "\n=== Expected Results ===\n";
echo "✅ No track_inventory references in Product model\n";
echo "✅ All products treated equally for inventory tracking\n";
echo "✅ ProductService queries simplified\n";
echo "✅ Factory creates clean product data\n";
echo "✅ Inventory starts at 0 by default\n";
echo "✅ Transaction factory works correctly\n";

echo "\n=== Migration Commands ===\n";
echo "To apply changes:\n";
echo "php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_06_17_110000_remove_track_inventory_from_products.php\n";

echo "\nTo test with fresh data:\n";
echo "php artisan migrate:fresh\n";
echo "php artisan db:seed --class=ProductSeeder\n";

echo "\n=== Verification Steps ===\n";
echo "1. Check products table schema (track_inventory column should be gone)\n";
echo "2. Test products list page (should load without errors)\n";
echo "3. Test inventory operations (should work for all products)\n";
echo "4. Test stock alerts (should generate for all products)\n";

echo "\n=== Track Inventory Removal Complete ===\n";
