## Issue Description
**Before Fix:**
- Invoice detail panel would move along with table when scrolling horizontally
- Panel would disappear from view when table scrolled to the right
- Users had to scroll back to see the detail panel content

**After Fix:**
- Panel should stay fixed at the left edge of the viewport during horizontal scroll
- Panel content should always remain visible regardless of table scroll position
- Panel should have sticky positioning with proper z-index layering

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Sticky Positioning
**Objective**: Verify panel has sticky positioning properties

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to invoice list page
2. Reduce browser width to ~800px to force horizontal scrolling
3. Click on any invoice row to expand detail panel
4. Inspect panel CSS properties using browser dev tools

**Expected Results**:
- `.invoice-detail-panel` has `position: sticky`
- `.invoice-detail-panel` has `left: 0`
- `.invoice-detail-panel` has `z-index: 99` or higher
- `.invoice-detail-container` has `position: sticky`
- `.invoice-detail-row td` has `position: sticky`

### Test 2: Horizontal Scroll Behavior
**Objective**: Verify panel stays fixed during table horizontal scroll

**Steps**:
1. Set browser width to 800px or less
2. Expand invoice detail panel
3. Note the panel position on screen
4. Scroll the table horizontally to the right using:
   - Horizontal scrollbar
   - Shift + mouse wheel
   - Touch/trackpad horizontal swipe
5. Observe panel position

**Expected Results**:
- Panel remains at the same position on screen
- Panel does not move with table scroll
- Panel content stays fully visible
- Table content scrolls behind the panel

### Test 3: Extreme Scroll Testing
**Objective**: Test panel behavior at maximum scroll positions

**Steps**:
1. Expand detail panel
2. Scroll table to maximum right position
3. Verify panel visibility and position
4. Scroll table to maximum left position
5. Verify panel visibility and position

**Expected Results**:
- Panel visible at maximum right scroll
- Panel visible at maximum left scroll
- Panel always positioned at left edge of viewport
- No content cutoff or overlap issues

### Test 4: Multiple Panels Sticky Behavior
**Objective**: Test sticky positioning with multiple open panels

**Steps**:
1. Expand first invoice detail panel
2. Expand second invoice detail panel
3. Scroll table horizontally
4. Observe both panels' behavior

**Expected Results**:
- Both panels maintain sticky positioning
- Both panels stay at left edge during scroll
- No z-index conflicts between panels
- Both panels remain fully accessible

### Test 5: Tab Switching During Scroll
**Objective**: Verify sticky positioning persists during tab interactions

**Steps**:
1. Expand detail panel
2. Scroll table horizontally
3. Switch between tabs in detail panel (Chi tiết hóa đơn, Lịch sử thanh toán)
4. Verify panel position after each tab switch

**Expected Results**:
- Panel maintains sticky position during tab switches
- Tab content loads properly while panel is sticky
- No layout shifts or positioning issues

### Test 6: Responsive Behavior
**Objective**: Test sticky positioning at different screen sizes

**Steps**:
1. Test at desktop size (1200px+)
2. Test at tablet size (768px - 1200px)
3. Test at mobile size (<768px)
4. For each size:
   - Expand detail panel
   - Scroll table horizontally if possible
   - Verify sticky behavior

**Expected Results**:
- Sticky positioning works at all screen sizes
- Panel adapts to viewport width appropriately
- No horizontal overflow issues
- Responsive design maintained

## CSS Properties to Verify

### Panel Sticky Properties:
```css
.invoice-detail-panel {
    position: sticky !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    z-index: 99 !important;
    background: white !important;
}
```

### Container Sticky Properties:
```css
.invoice-detail-container {
    position: sticky !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    z-index: 100 !important;
    background: white !important;
}
```

### Row Sticky Properties:
```css
.invoice-detail-row td {
    position: sticky !important;
    left: 0 !important;
    z-index: 98 !important;
    background: white !important;
}
```

### Table Container Properties:
```css
#kt_invoices_table_container {
    position: relative !important;
    overflow-x: auto !important;
}
```

## Browser Dev Tools Verification

### Check Computed Styles:
1. Right-click on detail panel → Inspect
2. In Elements tab, select `.invoice-detail-panel`
3. In Styles tab, verify computed values:
   - `position: sticky`
   - `left: 0px`
   - `z-index: 99` (or higher)
   - `background-color: white`

### Check Scroll Behavior:
1. In Console tab, run:
```javascript
// Check if table can scroll
const container = document.getElementById('kt_invoices_table_container');
console.log('Can scroll:', container.scrollWidth > container.clientWidth);
console.log('Scroll width:', container.scrollWidth);
console.log('Client width:', container.clientWidth);

// Test scroll
container.scrollLeft = 200;
console.log('Scroll position:', container.scrollLeft);
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Sticky Position**: Panel has `position: sticky` and `left: 0`
✅ **Fixed During Scroll**: Panel stays at left edge when table scrolls horizontally
✅ **Z-Index Layering**: Proper z-index hierarchy (container > panel > row)
✅ **Background**: White background prevents content showing through
✅ **Responsive**: Works at all screen sizes
✅ **Multiple Panels**: Multiple panels can be sticky simultaneously
✅ **Tab Functionality**: Tab switching works while panel is sticky
✅ **Performance**: No layout thrashing or visual glitches

## Common Issues to Check

### Panel Not Sticky:
- Check if `position: sticky` is applied
- Verify parent container has `position: relative`
- Check for conflicting CSS rules

### Panel Moves with Scroll:
- Verify `left: 0` is set
- Check z-index values
- Ensure background is set to prevent transparency

### Content Overlap:
- Check z-index hierarchy
- Verify background colors
- Test with different content lengths

### Performance Issues:
- Monitor for layout thrashing in dev tools
- Check for excessive repaints
- Verify smooth scrolling behavior

## Browser Compatibility

Test sticky positioning on:
- ✅ Chrome (latest) - Full support
- ✅ Firefox (latest) - Full support  
- ✅ Safari (latest) - Full support
- ✅ Edge (latest) - Full support

## Notes

- Sticky positioning requires a positioned ancestor
- Z-index only works on positioned elements
- Background color is crucial to prevent content bleeding through
- Some older browsers may need fallbacks (not required for this project)
- Performance should be monitored on lower-end devices
