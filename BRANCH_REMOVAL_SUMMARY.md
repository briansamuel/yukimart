### **6. Command Changes**

## ðŸ”„ **Migration Path**

### **To Apply Changes**
```bash
# Run the new migrations to remove branch references
php artisan migrate

# Re-seed data if needed (optional)
php artisan db:seed --class=BranchShopSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=SupplierSeeder
```

### **Rollback (if needed)**
```bash
# Rollback the migrations in reverse order
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=3
```

## âœ… **Verification**

### **Database Structure**
- âœ… `branches` table no longer exists
- âœ… `orders.branch_id` column removed
- âœ… `suppliers.branch_id` column removed
- âœ… All foreign key constraints properly removed

### **Code References**
- âœ… No remaining imports of `Branch` model
- âœ… No remaining calls to `branch()` relationships
- âœ… No remaining references to `branch_id` fields
- âœ… All tests updated to use `BranchShop`

### **Functionality**
- âœ… Order creation uses `branch_shop_id`
- âœ… Order relationships use `branchShop()`
- âœ… Supplier management no longer references branches
- âœ… All seeders work with branch shops only

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

The application now exclusively uses `branch_shops` for location management:
- **Orders** are associated with branch shops via `branch_shop_id`
- **Users** can be assigned to branch shops via `user_branch_shops` pivot table
- **Suppliers** no longer have branch associations (can be added to branch shops if needed)
- **Clean Architecture** with no legacy branch references

All functionality previously handled by branches is now managed through the more comprehensive branch shops system.
